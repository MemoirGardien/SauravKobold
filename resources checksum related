hashlib rsources:

hmac is a verification algorithm for hashli
https://pymotw.com/2/hmac/index.html       this is information on authentication & verification
https://docs.python.org/3/library/hmac.html      this is the hmac documentation information
   
   Note: the information I read shows that md5 and sha1 take about the same amount of time from a speed perspective  
   there are comments about md5 being "broken" all over the place online and notes to the effect of don't use, use sha1 instead
